# **1. Introduction to Design Patterns**

## **Overview**

**Design Patterns** are **standard solutions** to common software design problems.
They are **not complete programs** — instead, they are **reusable templates** that help you solve recurring design issues in an efficient and maintainable way.

You can think of them as **blueprints** for how to structure your code.

## **What Are Design Patterns?**

When you build large software systems, you often face similar problems:

* How to create objects efficiently?
* How to manage communication between classes?
* How to make the system easy to modify or extend?

Instead of reinventing the wheel every time, developers use **Design Patterns** — proven solutions discovered through years of experience.

## **Why Are Design Patterns Important?**

| **Benefit**         | **Explanation**                                                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reusability**     | You can use the same pattern in multiple projects.                          |
| **Readability**     | Other developers understand your code quickly since patterns are universal. |
| **Maintainability** | Code becomes easier to update or extend.                                    |
| **Scalability**     | Patterns make it easy to handle growing system complexity.                  |
| **Best Practices**  | They encourage cleaner and modular object-oriented design.                  |

## **Classification of Design Patterns**

Design patterns are generally divided into **three main categories**:

| **Type**                | **Purpose**                                                            | **Examples**                           |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Creational Patterns** | Deal with **object creation** mechanisms.                              | Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype |
| **Structural Patterns** | Deal with **class and object composition** (how objects are combined). | Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator  |
| **Behavioral Patterns** | Deal with **communication between objects**.                           | Observer, Strategy, Command, State     |

## **Simple C++ Example (Without a Pattern)**

Suppose you are writing a program to connect to a **database**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Database {
public:
    Database() {
        cout << "Database connected!\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Database db1;
    Database db2;  // creates another connection
}
```

Problem:
Every time you create an object (`db1`, `db2`), a **new database connection** is made — this wastes resources.

---

##  **Using a Design Pattern (Singleton Pattern Example)**

Now, let’s use a **design pattern** to fix this issue.

We’ll apply the **Singleton Pattern**, which ensures only **one instance** of a class exists.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Database {
private:
    static Database* instance;   // static pointer to hold one instance

    // private constructor (no one can create directly)
    Database() {
        cout << "Database connected!\n";
    }

public:
    // static function to access the single instance
    static Database* getInstance() {
        if (instance == nullptr)
            instance = new Database();
        return instance;
    }
};

// initialize static member
Database* Database::instance = nullptr;

int main() {
    Database* db1 = Database::getInstance();
    Database* db2 = Database::getInstance();

    if (db1 == db2)
        cout << "Both objects point to the same instance!\n";
}
```

### Output:

```
Database connected!
Both objects point to the same instance!
```

 This means **only one database connection** is created — that’s the **power of design patterns**.
